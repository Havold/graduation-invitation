          <p>Dear my friend,</p>
          <p>
            As this precious chapter of my university life comes to a close, I’m
            filled with gratitude looking back on the journey we've shared. My
            graduation day is just around the corner — a milestone that marks
            not only the end of student life but also the beginning of a new
            chapter in adulthood.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to sincerely thank you for being by my side through it all —
            for the laughter, the tears, the highs and the lows. Your presence
            has meant so much to me throughout these unforgettable years.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would mean the world to me if you could join and celebrate this
            special moment together. Let’s make one more beautiful memory to add
            to our story.
          </p>
          <p>With all my heart,</p>
        </div>
        <span className="signature">Truong Huu Tho.</span>
